# Coding Best Practices

## File Organization
- Create small and focused files
- Break down large files into multiple smaller modules
- Each file should have a single, clear responsibility
- Extract reusable logic into separate utility files

## Code Structure
1. Modular Design
   - Separate concerns into distinct modules
   - Use clear and consistent naming conventions
   - Keep modules focused and cohesive

2. File Organization
   - Group related files in descriptive folders
   - Use index files to expose public interfaces
   - Keep folder structure flat when possible

3. Code Quality
   - Write clear, self-documenting code
   - Add meaningful comments for complex logic
   - Use TypeScript for better type safety
   - Follow consistent formatting

4. Error Handling
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use custom error types
   - Log errors with context
   - Provide meaningful error messages

5. Testing
   - Write unit tests for core functionality
   - Include integration tests
   - Test error cases
   - Maintain high test coverage

## Best Practices
1. Dependency Management
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Use specific version numbers
   - Document dependency purposes
   - Minimize external dependencies

2. Configuration
   - Use environment variables
   - Implement proper secret management
   - Separate config from code
   - Document configuration options

3. Logging
   - Implement structured logging
   - Include relevant context
   - Use appropriate log levels
   - Monitor and rotate logs

4. Performance
   - Optimize critical paths
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Profile performance bottlenecks

5. Security
   - Follow security best practices
   - Validate input data
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Use secure communication
